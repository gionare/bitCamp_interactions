Find the Maximum Subarray Sum: 
Write a function that takes an array of integers as input 
and finds the contiguous subarray within the array that has the largest sum. 
Return the sum of that subarray. 
For example, given the array [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4], 
the function should return 6, which corresponds to the sum of the subarray [4, -1, 2, 1].

Rotate Array: 
Write a function that rotates an array of n elements to the right by k steps. 
For example, given the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and k = 3, 
the function should modify the array to become [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Find Missing Number: 
Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, 
find the missing number. 
For example, given the array [3, 0, 1], the function should return 2.

Merge Intervals: 
Given an array of intervals, 
merge overlapping intervals and return the resulting merged intervals. 
For example, given the intervals [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]], the function should return [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]].
